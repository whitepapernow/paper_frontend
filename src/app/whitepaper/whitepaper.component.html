        This is an <b>open white paper</b> that will be available for editing by relevance. A paper that will evolve via open source collaboration and voting on the most appropriate outcome that needs to be implemented. Because the white paper will go through evolution, the terms blockchain / tangle/ hashgraph and similar decentralized distributed ledger based technologies may be used intergangerbly unless stated by context. The platform proposed is based on the stated technologies. On the basis that an online <b>multi peer transparent system</b> can build newer technologies, tackle technological, environmental and socioeconomic issues together. At the same time logging the influence and merit of each contribution and rewarding the contributor fairly. To keep this platform pure, the platform architecture must be impregnated by the community. A voted decision with every step, from the name to the best suited technology used. Learning and stripping away all unnecessary complexities from other blockchain, hashgraph, tangle, and similar platforms. This is a skeleton white paper in which every topic is open to community debate and editing.

          The internet has been the catalyst in technological advancement for the last few decades. But it also has been the platform for intellectual thievery and technological mismanagement. We propose a blockchain based platform that builds the best products using mass collaboration and consensus. In the current climate, some workers have been reluctant to perform their best under the assumption that their employer will steal their ideas and they will not be paid fairly. There is a lack of innovation and employees are jumping around from job to job in search of better work benefits and pay. Companies are reaching out for great ideas outside of their employed professionals and at the same time to keep their employees. Companies need a decentralized validation platform in real time to validate their products and work. Workers need a trust platform that rewards them fairly. The world needs only the best products that are well made and use the least resources.

          A platform that can show a transparent relationship between product and people, technologically, environmentally, and socioeconomically will essentially be more attractive than an unethical product full of negative externalities. As more products raise the ethics bar, the rest of the products will be held to these standards. This builds a higher standard for the entire economics environment. This builds better products. This uses less resources.

          Having the security to give your ideas under time stamped and legal protection will allow people to grow ideas faster. Not only is a worthy idea recognized and rewarded upon implementation, but it also helps evolve other people’s ideas and thus the branches and leaves from the tree of these ideas are rewarded as well. Any time - all or part of these ideas are reused in any smart project, they will be linked and further reward is given. So what may seem like a small reward in the beginning will over time grow as many more smart projects are built on the platform. The gift that keeps on giving is merit.

          We aim to start with a communal consensus of which digital ledger technology will be best suited for this platform. Each step will be cleared by the community. The basic function of the platform will also be used to build the platform. All parts of the platform will be discussed and reviewed by the community before implementation. The curators will act more as janitors for the platform instead of rulers. Over time, better qualified curators will be cycled to keep the best interest of the community and platform intact. The technology chosen to build the platform must be heavily scrutinized before implementation to ensure it holds up in the future.

                  Hashgraph is said to be a more robust system. Its consensus algorithm provides a new platform for distributed consensus. Some of the attributes commonly used to refer or describe Blockchain are distributed, transparent, consensus-based, transactional and flexible. Hashgraph bears all these features. However, it is a data structure and consensus algorithm that is much faster, fairer, and more secure than blockchain. It is described as future of distributed ledger technology. It uses two special techniques to achieve fast, fair and secure consensus.

          To provide best products and fair pay. Safeguarding ideas and inventions gives people more security and faith to work transparently with peers. Companies can secure best products by fairly paying for ideas and not be worried about future lawsuits. Efficiency and value will rise with each new smart project. More information means stronger connections and faster communications. This secures all parties involved in the making of the product. Blockchain technology is currently the best technology to achieve this system. By keeping a log of all your ideas and jobs, a personal profile is build based on the proven jobs you complete rather than a piece of paper negotiating your intellect. This gives everyone a platform to achieve and corporate.

          Companies that uses this platform also opens themselves up as trustworthy to the general public. And at the same time gains public intuition and perspective so that they don’t have to compete in brainwashing the public to want their product, but rather use the public to help build a product that the public already wants.
